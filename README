!!!WORK IN PROGRESS!!!

This package contains several tools.
 - xcorrSound is a tool to find the overlap between two audio files.
 - soundMatch is a tool to find all occurences of a shorter wav within a larger wav
 - migrationQA is a tool that splits two audio files into equal sized blocks and outputs the correlation for each block (a_i,b_i), if a and b was the input.

The tools all make use of cross correlation, which can be computed through the fourier transform.

Note that all the tools will need access to write to a file called <tool>.log where various information about a run will be stored.

INSTALL

    Run

    ./install.sh

    This will install the fftw3 library.

    Depending on which tool is needed, run
    make <tool>
    where <tool> is either "xcorrSound", "soundMatch" or "migrationQA" (quotes for clarity)


USE

Example: xcorrSound

Syntax:

xcorrSound ANALYSIS_FILE_1.wav ANALYSIS_FILE_2.wav

Output example:

The best match was below the threshold of 0.2
Best at sample number: 11520000
Best at second: 240
Value of match was: 0.132016

In the log various information relating to the wav files can be found,
such as samplerate, number of channels and so on.
